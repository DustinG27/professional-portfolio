                  I am originally from a background in film and media specializing in
                  lighting, lighting design, and writing. I has always been my dream
                  to work behind the camera and see how all my forvite films and shows
                  were made. After a few years of freelancing I decided that I would
                  rather have a stable job in one location.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  This is when I made the choice to jump straight into the programming
                  world. I have always loved technology. One of my favorite hobbies is
                  taking apart various electronics and building them again with
                  different shells. Once I had a grasp on hardware I wanted to move
                  onto software and the core of computer technology.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  From here, I would like to keep pursuing my hobbies and gaining more
                  skills. Eventually, I will build a gaming cabnet from the ground up.
                </p>

                  I also love beer. I have brewed my own, as well as, worked in a
                  brewery. I got to drink beer while I worked! How cool is that
                  shit?
